Predicting Cincinnati Housing Prices using Regression
The Purpose of this project is to first study and analyse what has been the trend in the selling price of houses in Cincinnati area by looking at the data collected from websites - Zillow and Trulia.

Quick Summary of Final Model : We have built 2 models, one using a bigger dataset with less number of covariates, and other small dataset with additional variables, because we have sparse dataset. The plan is to average the two models to arrive at the final prediction.

We arrived at the below equations finally:
